# Garbage-Classification-Deep-Learning-Model
Project in ENEL 645 - Data Mining and Machine Learning (Completed in April 2024)

The purpose of this project was to make a garbage image classifier to identify what bin (Black, Blue, Green, Other) various pieces of garbage should be assigned to.

### Note: Models were trained through Google Collab so the code currently loads data in through Google Drive. The first 2 blocks of code will need to be adjusted if someone wants to load in the data themselves locally for further testing.
