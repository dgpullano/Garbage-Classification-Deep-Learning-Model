# Garbage-Classification-Deep-Learning-Model
Project in ENEL 645 - Data Mining and Machine Learning (Completed in April 2024)

The purpose of this project was to make a garbage image classifier to identify what bin (Black, Blue, Green, Other) various pieces of garbage should be assigned to.

The dataset (approx. 10 GB) can be accessed through the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VGGVydFSiZ0EJBrbMzlg5fOWYVtddNLj/view

### Note: Models were trained through Google Collab so the code currently loads data in through a Google Drive account. The first 2 blocks of code will need to be adjusted if someone wants to load in the data themselves locally for further testing.
